    <p><h1>How to Make a Homemade Pizza Crust</h1></p>

    <p>If you're looking for a homemade pizza crust recipe that's great for beginners, you're in luck.</p>
    <p>This top-rated recipe is super easy to throw together on a whim â€“ and it puts the store-bought stuff to shame.</p>
    <p>Learn how to make the best pizza crust of your life with just a few ingredients, find out how to shape the dough, and get our best storage secrets.</p>
    <p>You need just five ingredients (plus some warm water) to make this super simple pizza crust.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><b>Yeast:</b> Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes the pizza dough to rise.</li>
        <li><b>Sugar:</b> To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon of sugar.</li>
        <li><b>Bread Flour:</b> Bread flour is ideal for pizza crust becauseit creates chewier results than all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><b>Olive Oil:</b> Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: Not only does it add color and flavor, but it creates a barrier between the oil and water.</li>
        <li><b>Salt:</b> A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a chewier crust), and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise).</li>
    
    </ul>
